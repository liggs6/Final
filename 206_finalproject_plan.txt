Put your name here: Brian Liggio

----

Which option for the final project are you choosing -- 1, 2, or 3?

IF YOU ARE CHOOSING OPTION 3, answer the following questions: Option 2

* Write 1-3 sentences summarizing what the goal of your project is:

My project will focus on Twitter stats.  I will focus on number of hashtags of a movie name and see how that corresponds to the movieâ€™s imdv rating.

* What are your two data sources? Provide links to documentation or websites you will be getting data from.
Tweepy
http://www.omdbapi.com/



* Why are you proposing this project?

I feel most comfortable working with Twitter and OMDB because we worked with Twitter a lot all semester and I have experience working with the OMDB API from SI 106


* What will the output of this project be? What will it look like, and what information will it contain?

The output of this project will be a text file that includes 3 movie names, their imdb ratings, and the numbers of hashtags about the movie.  Then I might try to calculate the ratio between movie rating and number of mentions on twitter.  This is all in addition to the uploads to the database. 


* What are your concerns about this proposal?

I am mostly concerned about the process of completing the project.  My concern is about where to start, and what steps to take from there.  Also, if I run into trouble, I am worried that I will get confused and have trouble trying to fix the project.
-----

THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS ARE FOR EVERYONE. (Though they may be easier if you are choosing Option 1 or 2, because you can reference the Option 1 or 2 instructions.)

* What will at least one of the classes you're going to define be called?

Movie

* What will that class take as input to its constructor?

A dictionary that represents a movie

* What will 1 instance of this class represent?

The imdb score of the movie

* What are 3 instance variables this class will have? What will they be called, and what information will they hold? Why are they important?

self.title:  This variable will hold the title of the movie.  This is important to help distinguish which movie is being used.

self.score:  This variable will hold the imdb score of the movie.  It is important because my project will utilize imdb scores often.
 
self.actor:  This variable will hold a list of prominent actors in the movie.  This is important because it provide more information about the movie.



* Explain 2 methods the class will have that are not the class constructor (__init__ method) by answering the following questions for each. 
ONE METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?
movie_score

- What will the method do?
obtain the imdv score of a movie

- Will it take any additional input? 
no

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

It should change the instance variable so as to contain the imdb score.

- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

The program needs to obtain movie scores

ANOTHER METHOD:
- What will the name of the method be?

twitter_score
- What will the method do?

It will associate a movie with the amount of mentions it gets on Twitter.
- Will it take any additional input? 
no

- Will it return anything? Should it change anything about the instance/an instance variable? 

It will change the instance variable so as to include the amount of mentions that a movie has on twitter. 


- Why is it useful for this class definition, in this program?

The program needs to be able to gather the amount of times a movie is mentioned.


[If you definitely want to have a third, feel free to answer those questions a third time, because you'll have to do so eventually. when you write documentation!]


* What will the tables in your database be?

There will be three tables in my database, Tweets, Users, Movies


* What fields will each database table have? Which field of them is the primary key? You should list the fields for each database table here, e.g.
Tweets:
- text
- ID (Primary Key)
- user
- movie
- favs
- rts
- mentions

Users:
- User_ID (Primary Key)
- screen_name
- user_favs
- info

Movies:
- Mov_ID (Primary Key)
- title
- director
- languages
- IMDB
- actor
- info


* List, in English, 2 queries you'll want to make from your database. At least one should be a JOIN. You can always change these later, but start with  ideas you're interested in and lessen the work on yourself later on! 
(e.g. from class examples, maybe "I want to make a query that accesses the numbers of times each user has favorited tweets, and the number of times tweets that user posted have been favorited -- so I'll be joining the Tweets table and the Users table")



* What are at least 2 of the data processing mechanics you're planning to use?
 
I want to make a query to access the number of mentions a certain movie has, so I will be joining the movies and tweets tables.

I want to make a query to access the IMDB score of a movie.



* Why will each of those be useful to you? What data might you use it on? 
(e.g. "Set comprehension: I think I'm going to be looking for unique names and proper nouns in this big set of text, so I'm going to use a set comprehension"). 
>>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<
The first query will be useful because pair a movie with its number of mentions is the main goal of my program.

I plan to use list comprehension, set comprehension, and dictionary accumulation

* What will your output look like? Will it be a .txt file? a CSV file? something else? What information will it contain? >>>This is especially important if you are doing Option 3, but it's important for everyone!<<<

The output will be in the format of a text file.  It will contain information about certain movies including the IMDB score of each movie and the number of mentions that each movie received.
